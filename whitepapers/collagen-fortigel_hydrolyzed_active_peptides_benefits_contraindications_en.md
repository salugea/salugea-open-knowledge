## 1. Introduction  
Cartilage damage in joints is a widespread issue, with a study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies showing a 60 % prevalence of cartilage lesions.  
FORTIGEL® is a patented formulation of bioactive collagen peptides (~3 kDa) derived from bovine collagen, shown to support cartilage health.  
This document provides a detailed, science-based comparison of origin, mechanism, clinical evidence, and practical implications.

## 2. Origin of FORTIGEL® and Hydrolysis Process  
- FORTIGEL® is produced by Gelita AG through enzymatic hydrolysis of bovine collagen.  
- The resulting peptide size is approximately 3 kDa.  
- The patented process ensures peptides that stimulate chondrocytes and matrix production.

---

## 3. Mechanism of Action on Articular Cartilage  
- Orally ingested peptides are absorbed and reach cartilage tissue, stimulating type II collagen synthesis and proteoglycan production.  
- Clinical trials (5 g/day for 24 weeks) in athletes showed statistically significant reduction of joint pain.  
- Additional trial (12 weeks, 5 g/day) in younger adults demonstrated improved mobility and reduced use of secondary therapy.

---

## 4. Clinical Scientific Evidence  
- Multiple randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials support efficacy in activity-related joint pain.  
- Evidence supports the need for adequate dosage (5 g/day) and treatment duration (≥ 12-24 weeks).  
- The combination of dose + formulation quality is critical.

---

## 5. Benefits for Joints and Cartilage  
- Reduction in perceived joint discomfort, improved mobility.  
- Stimulating regeneration of the cartilage matrix.  
- Relevant for athletes, individuals with cartilage wear, and those seeking joint health maintenance.

---

## 6. Contraindications and Safety Considerations  
- Generally well tolerated.  
- Precautionary advice: consult healthcare provider if allergic to ingredients, pregnant or breastfeeding, or taking medications.  
- Evaluate product quality and formulation credentials.

---

## 7. Conclusions and Recommendations  
- FORTIGEL® is among the most extensively researched collagen peptide solutions for cartilage support.  
- Efficacy depends on formulation quality, dose, and duration of use.  
- Practical recommendation: choose products backed by clinical evidence, integrate with healthy lifestyle, and seek professional guidance.
