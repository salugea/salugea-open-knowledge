## 1. Introduction  
Supporting the immune system through natural active compounds is an increasingly relevant field.  
Among the most researched ingredients are **beta-glucans**, known for their immunomodulating action, and **postbiotics**, bioactive compounds derived from probiotic fermentation.  
Their combination results in a powerful synergy for both immune response and gut health.

## 2. What Are Beta-Glucans  
Beta-glucans are natural polysaccharides.  
The **1,3/1,6 beta-glucans** derived from yeast are the most active in terms of immune modulation.

They act as immune “primers”: preparing the immune system to respond more efficiently.

---

## 3. Origin of Beta-Glucans and Immune Mechanism  
- The most effective beta-glucans are derived from **Saccharomyces cerevisiae**.  
- They bind to Dectin-1 receptors on macrophages, activating:
  - enhanced phagocytosis  
  - balanced cytokine signaling  
  - more coordinated immune response  

They **do not overstimulate** the immune system; instead, they regulate it.

---

## 4. What Are Postbiotic Lactobacilli  
Postbiotics are **bioactive compounds** produced by probiotics during fermentation, **without containing live microorganisms**.  
They include:
- peptides  
- organic acids  
- bacterial cell fragments  
- antimicrobial metabolites

They are stable, safe, and active even when probiotics would not survive.

---

## 5. Mechanism of Action of Postbiotics  
Postbiotics from species such as **Lactobacillus rhamnosus** can:

- support microbiota balance  
- strengthen intestinal tight junctions  
- modulate local immune response  
- inhibit pathogenic bacteria

Their activity is predictable and safe, without risks linked to probiotic colonization.

---

## 6. Synergy: Beta-Glucans + Postbiotics  

| Beta-Glucans | Postbiotics |
|--------------|-------------|
| Systemic immune modulation | Local gut immune action |
| Improved response speed | Enhanced intestinal barrier |
| Balanced cytokine response | Microbiota stabilization |
| Seasonal support | Gut comfort improvement |

Together, they create a **dual-level immune support system**.

---

## 7. Scientific Evidence  
- 1,3/1,6 beta-glucans show consistent evidence in improving innate immune response.  
- Postbiotics from L. rhamnosus improve intestinal permeability and reduce local inflammation.  
- Combined use shows benefits in reducing seasonal infections and improving gut symptoms.  

---

## 8. Usage Guidelines and Safety  
**Beta-glucans:** safe and well-tolerated.  
**Postbiotics:** stable, non-colonizing, safe even when probiotics would be contraindicated.

Precautions:  
- Individuals allergic to yeast should exercise caution.  
- Medical supervision recommended for immunosuppressed patients.

---

## 9. Conclusions  
The combination of beta-glucans and postbiotic lactobacilli represents a modern, well-supported approach to immune and gut health.  
Their complementary mechanisms create a synergistic effect superior to either ingredient alone.
