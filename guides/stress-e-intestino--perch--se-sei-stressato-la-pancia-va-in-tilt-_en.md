# Stress and the intestine: why does your tummy go haywire when you're stressed? (English Version)

**Original Date:** 2025-10-23

Has it ever happened to you to have an important meeting, maybe precisely one where you had to speak, and suddenly... **boom**! You had to run to the bathroom faster than a marathon runner?

Or, during a stressful period, to have your intestine blocked, like traffic during rush hour? It is not a coincidence, **stress and intestine are connected**.

Our intestine is extremely sensitive and, when stress knocks on the door, it reacts—and not always in the best way.

But why does it happen and, above all, how can we remedy it? Let's find out together!

Here is the detailed index of the article:

* How the intestine reacts to stress.
* Stress and Intestine: probiotics and natural remedies.
* How to relax the intestine in case of stress.
* What "stress poop" is like and what to do.
* TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) - Which emotion is linked to the intestine.

## How the intestine reacts to stress

Do you want to know how the intestine reacts to stress? **Badly!** ☹

After all, which of us faces a stressful event with serenity?

In a situation of calm and tranquility, the intestine works efficiently: **it digests food, absorbs essential nutrients, and discards what is not needed, eliminating it with feces.**

But if a stress factor disturbs its work, the intestine can react in different ways:

* **runs wildly** → you are forced to run to the bathroom
* **blocks like a stubborn mule** → moments of constipation
* **throws some tantrums** → bloating, borborygmi (rumbling), and other discomforts

But it doesn't end here! When the intestine suffers from stress, **our mood also suffers**. Why? Simple! It is precisely in the intestine that most of the **serotonin, the happiness hormone**, is produced.

All this happens because **stress and intestine are connected through the gut-brain axis**.

When you experience a situation of anxiety or stress, the brain sends alarm signals to the intestine, which responds by entering "panic" mode too.


## Stress and Intestine: probiotics and natural remedies

If your intestine has been suffering from stress for a while already, you can evaluate intervening with **probiotics**, **prebiotics**, and **specific plant extracts**.

Let's start with probiotics. These are **live and vital microorganisms** which, if taken in the right quantities, **favor the balance of intestinal flora and support its well-being**.

But their action is much broader. You must know, in fact, that some probiotics can **positively influence gut-brain communication**, modulating the response to stress and contributing to managing stressful conditions, mood alterations, and even sleep quality.

But there is a problem. **The biggest challenge is getting them unharmed into the intestine!** During the journey, in fact, they must cross the acidic environment of the stomach, which can destroy them before they can perform their function.

For this reason, it is fundamental to choose **probiotics enclosed in acid-resistant capsules**, which protect them and ensure their functional efficiency.

And it doesn't end here. Good bacteria living in the intestine, to survive and multiply, **need nourishment**. Here **prebiotic fibers** come into play, such as those of inulin for example, which provide the food necessary for their development and contribute to the well-being of the intestinal microbiota.

As for **plant extracts**, some can be particularly useful for **managing stress** and calming a hyperactive intestine that suffers from it. Among these, **Griffonia and Mallow (Malva)** stand out.

Let's get to know these plants and their action better:

* **Griffonia**: can favor sleep quality, improve mood tone, and help maintain calm and serenity in moments of stress.
* **Mallow**: performs a soothing action and contributes to the **regularity of intestinal transit**, as well as favoring the normal consistency and volume of feces... a topic we will return to shortly! ☺

*Dulcis in fundo* (Last but not least), but not least in importance. Remember to always listen to your body and notice the signals your tummy sends you. If you notice that discomforts are persistent and interfere with the quality of life, talk to the doctor, you will see that he will know how to listen to you and advise you.

## How to relax the intestine when it is "stressed"

If you want to calm your intestine, here are some useful suggestions.

The first thing to do? **Breathe and relax.**

I know, easier said than done! But techniques like **diaphragmatic breathing, yoga, and meditation** can make a difference. Even just **closing your eyes and taking a few deep breaths** can contribute. You will see that your intestine will thank you!

**Move!** Physical activity is a great ally against stress and intestinal disorders. **A walk after meals** supports digestion and can have a positive influence even on slowed intestinal transit. While doing sports regularly is the enemy of stress and can have a positive action on intestinal regularity.

## What is "stress poop" like?

It's not the best of conversations, I know, but knowing the "secret meaning of feces" can tell you something more about the state of intestinal well-being.

Here is how feces can be when a stressful situation puts a strain on the intestine:

* **Soft and poorly formed feces** → When you are stressed, your intestine alters the fluid reabsorption process, making it less efficient. Result? Liquid feces and sudden runs to the bathroom!
* **Hard feces difficult to expel** → In some cases, when stress situations manifest, the intestine closes up like a hedgehog and slows down intestinal transit. The result? Feces can be hard and associated with difficulty going to the bathroom.
* **Irregular feces** → One day you are constipated, the next day you have diarrhea? Your intestine is confused! This can be the signal that stress is playing nasty tricks.

If the problem persists, better talk to a doctor!

## TCM - Which emotion is linked to the intestine?

The intestine is much more than a simple digestive organ. It is closely connected to our emotions, particularly to **happiness and sadness**.

If you want to deepen the link between intestine and emotions you can read **this article**.

Let me explain better immediately.

### Happiness and intestine: the serotonin laboratory

The intestine is responsible for the production of about **90% of serotonin**, the neurotransmitter of good mood.

This means that our emotional well-being is strongly influenced by intestinal well-being. An intestine in balance favors a more serene mind and a positive state of mind, while an alteration of intestinal balance can be reflected in mood and energy levels.

### Sadness and intestine: the link with Traditional Chinese Medicine

In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the large intestine (*Da Chang*) is associated with the **Metal** element and represents detachment and the ability to let go, particularly the past, to make room for the present.

Intestinal imbalance can manifest itself not only with physical symptoms but also with **sadness, melancholy, and emotional closure**. For Traditional Chinese Medicine, those who struggle to process a change or let go of situations from the past may also suffer at the intestinal level, with episodes of **constipation** or, conversely, **diarrhea**, as if the intestine were trying to expel what the mind retains.

Taking care of your intestine is not only a matter of physical well-being but also of emotional well-being!

And you, would you ever have imagined that the intestine had such an important role in processing emotions and letting them go at the right time? Write it to us in the comments, we look forward to reading you!
