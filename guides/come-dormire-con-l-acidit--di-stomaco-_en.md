## Stomach acidity: how many pillows to use for sleeping

One of the most frequent questions among those suffering from **stomach acidity is: how many pillows should I use** to sleep well without annoying acid regurgitation?

If you are wondering this too, here is the answer!

One of the simplest and most effective strategies to sleep better in case of stomach acidity is to **use two pillows to support the head**. This raised position helps to counteract the rising of gastric acids towards the esophagus during the night. That is why it is recommended.

Keeping the torso slightly raised exploits the effect of gravity, which helps keep acids inside the stomach, reducing their impact on the esophageal mucosa and limiting annoying manifestations during the night.

You must know that the esophagus is a kind of "tube" that connects the mouth to the stomach and that its mucosa is less "resistant" to acids than that of the stomach. That is why, when gastric acids rise along it, they can create discomfort, such as burning and acidity.

**If you find sleeping with two pillows uncomfortable**, you can opt for an **inclined pillow** (wedge pillow) designed specifically for this purpose. Alternatively, if you have an adjustable bed, you could slightly tilt the upper part to achieve the same result.

## Right or left side? Which to choose to sleep with acidity

Another common question among those suffering from stomach acidity is: **on which side is it better to sleep to avoid stomach acids rising?**

It is often recommended to sleep on the **left side**, as this position helps the lower esophageal sphincter (a sort of "valve") to function better, reducing the risk of gastric acids rising into the esophagus.

Conversely, sleeping on the **right side** could worsen the problem because pressure on the stomach is increased, favoring the rising of gastric content.

Try sleeping on your left side and verify if this position helps you rest better! ?

## Stomach acidity: what to take before sleeping

**Before going to sleep**, we advise you to **avoid meals that are too large or elaborate**, so as not to make digestion difficult and favor a more peaceful rest.

Do you know why gastric acidity is created?

The stomach uses gastric acids to digest food, but when we eat too much, too quickly, or consume spicy or fatty foods, it can get "irritated". If the valve between the stomach and esophagus does not close well, acids can rise, causing that annoying sensation of burning or acid regurgitation that often ruins sleep. You know what I'm referring to, right?

In these cases, you could consider some natural remedies with a beneficial action on digestive function and gastric well-being.

Among plant extracts, **Amla** can exercise an **acid control action**, while **Rice**, thanks to its starchy component, can perform both an action on acidity and an **emollient action** on the mucous membranes of the digestive tract, which can be "bothered" by acid secretions.

Alongside these remedies, salts such as Calcium Carbonate, Potassium Bicarbonate, and Magnesium Citrate can exercise a buffering effect against acidity, a bit like when soaking up excess water with a sponge, bringing the environment back to a situation of comfort and balance.

Also, some digestive enzymes, such as **Papain** and **Lipase**, can contribute to supporting digestion, supporting the work of the stomach.

All these ingredients have been selected and combined in the 100% natural formula of **Reflugea Rapido Salugea**, whose synergistic action can offer a rapid response to evening discomforts due to gastric acidity.

Finally, we also remember the **extracts of Mallow (Malva) and Linden (Tiglio)**, two plants known for their **soothing and calming properties**, present in **Reflugea Forte Salugea**. Let's get to know them better.

Mallow - which is also present in Reflugea Rapido Salugea - is rich in mucilages that can create a sort of "protective barrier" for the stomach mucosa, helping to reduce irritation-type discomforts.

Linden, thanks to its relaxing properties, can contribute to favoring rest and managing stress. Something that can prove useful when this tends to make itself felt even at the gastric level.

Following these simple precautions and evaluating some natural remedies to support gastric well-being, you could support your rest and say goodbye to agitated and sleepless nights!

Please, if these manifestations are persistent, talk to your doctor and evaluate the condition and the treatment to follow with him.

### Why stress is the enemy of sleep and digestion

When we are stressed, our body enters "alarm mode". In very simple words, it prepares to act and react: a situation that is perceived as danger.

This activates a series of physiological processes, including an increase in the production of hormones like cortisol.

Cortisol, particularly when its levels are altered, and stress can negatively affect both gastric and emotional well-being. For example, they can contribute to:

* stimulating the stomach to produce **more acids** than necessary;
* slowing down digestion, causing food to remain in the stomach longer and increasing the risk of reflux;
* making falling asleep more difficult and interfering with sleep quality.

This is why it is important to try to keep stress levels under control to support digestive well-being and good rest.

## Wellness tips for sleeping in case of stomach acidity

Now that you have discovered **the recommended side to sleep on in case of acidity**, **how many pillows to use**, and **which natural remedies it is useful to take**, the time has come to discover some simple and effective wellness advice to support good rest and control acidity.

Here is where to start:

* to sleep, wear soft clothes that do not exert pressure or tighten on the abdomen;
* maintain balance and body weight. A pronounced abdomen, or excess weight, can have a negative action on gastric well-being and digestion;
* relax before and after eating. The way we eat can have a huge impact on digestion. If you feel in the grip of stress, or something has bothered you, before eating try to relax, perhaps by doing a cycle of deep breaths, or an activity you like. I don't know about you, but I love reading a few pages of a book before eating;
* after eating try not to get immediately into a supine position, because you could make digestion more difficult. Try to keep your torso raised, or take "four steps" before going to bed, if the season allows it;
* try to avoid drinking carbonated and too cold water. Better to drink natural water at room temperature, especially in case of acidity and abdominal swelling;
* chew every bite well and don't rush when you are at the table. Digestion starts in the mouth, don't forget it!

Here we are at the end of the article. What do you think of the tips we gave you? Will you try sleeping with two pillows and on your left side for stomach acidity?
