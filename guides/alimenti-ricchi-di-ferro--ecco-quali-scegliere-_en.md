## The difference between Heme Iron and Non-heme Iron

If you are looking for **foods rich in Iron**, it is probably because you are not sure you are getting enough. Did I guess right?

Iron is a fundamental nutrient for the well-being of the organism and its deficiency can lead to a condition of **iron deficiency anemia**, very frequent in women and among athletes. Iron deficiency is common especially in women of childbearing age, usually due to particularly heavy menstrual flow.

**It is possible to take an adequate amount of Iron with diet**, provided you know what the richest food sources of this precious mineral are. And in this regard, you must know that there are two types of Iron:

* **Heme Iron**: present in foods of animal origin
* **Non-heme Iron**: present in foods of vegetable origin

The difference between these two types of Iron lies in their assimilability. Compared to non-heme Iron, heme Iron is more easily assimilated by the body. Not everyone knows that it is possible to promote Iron absorption thanks to **Vitamin C**.

A little trick to assimilate the Iron present in foods is to **add a few drops of lemon juice**. This applies whether it refers to foods of vegetable origin like green leafy vegetables, or foods of animal origin like meat.

## Why Iron is important

Iron is an important mineral because it participates in the formation of red blood cells and that of **hemoglobin**, a protein involved in the transport of Oxygen to the body.

Symptoms such as tiredness, dizziness, mental confusion, and fatigue could represent alarm bells to pay attention to. If you feel this way, talk to your doctor and among the next blood tests remember to also check the levels of:

* **sideremia** (serum iron): a test that indicates the amount of Iron present in the blood
* **ferritin**: a test that indicates the Iron reserves available to the body
* **complete blood count (CBC)**: which provides a detailed picture of the value of hemoglobin and red blood cells

Now that you have discovered the difference between Heme Iron and Non-heme Iron, we can move on to foods rich in this element and we will start with those of animal origin.


## Foods rich in Heme Iron

Have you already grabbed pen and paper? If you haven't taken them yet, get them immediately because there are some notes to take. The list of **foods rich in Heme Iron** includes:

* veal and beef
* chicken
* eggs
* pork
* oily fish (blue fish)

## Foods rich in Non-heme Iron

Are you following a vegetarian diet and want to know which plant foods are richest in Iron? Said and done! Here is a list of **foods containing Non-heme Iron**:

* lentils
* beans
* mung beans
* spinach
* tofu
* tempeh
* dark green leafy vegetables
* broccoli
* seeds and dried fruit/nuts
* green beans
* peas

If you follow a vegan or vegetarian diet, **you can optimize intestinal Iron absorption by consuming vegetables containing vitamin C during main meals**.

## The recommended Iron requirement

Iron requirements vary based on sex, age, and the person's condition. For example, in pregnancy and breastfeeding, its requirement increases significantly to meet the needs of the mother and the unborn child.

According to what is indicated in the LARN (Reference Intake Levels of Nutrients), the recommended daily Iron requirement is:

* 7 mg for men aged between 18 and 69 years
* 10 mg for women aged between 18 and 59 years
* 22 mg for pregnant women
* 8 mg during breastfeeding

A varied and balanced diet is the best means to ensure the body has an adequate amount of this mineral. In case of Iron values lower than those considered normal, it is possible to associate specific natural supplementation with the diet.

## Causes of Iron deficiency and how to integrate it naturally

There are several factors that can cause an **Iron deficiency**. Among the **most common causes** we have:

* heavy menstrual flow
* malabsorption
* peptic ulcer
* hemorrhoids
* chronic diarrhea
* use of particular categories of **drugs** such as antacids

It is possible to evaluate Iron supplementation:

* When sideremia and ferritin values are lower than those considered normal
* in cases of greater need by the organism

You can talk about it with your attending physician and agree with him on the treatment to follow.

A 100% natural supplement that provides Iron is **Ferro + B12 Salugea**. In its formulation, in addition to Iron, there is also **Vitamin B12**, which participates in Iron metabolism, and **Vitamin C** which optimizes its absorption.

Ferro + B12 Salugea is different from other supplements on the market because its formulation **provides Iron pyrophosphate in liposomal form**. The liposomal form makes Iron much gentler on the gastric mucosa and avoids the annoying aftertaste characteristic of most supplements of this precious mineral.

Completing the formula of Ferro + B12 is **Copper**, a trace element involved in many enzymatic reactions of the organism and in the transport of Iron in the bloodstream.
