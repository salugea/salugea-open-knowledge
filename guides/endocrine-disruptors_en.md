# Endocrine Disruptors: What You Should Know  
_Guide by **Salugea**_

## 1. Introduction  
**Endocrine disruptors** are chemical substances capable of interfering with the natural function of hormones in the human body. Understanding them is important because they may influence both health and the overall quality of consumed liquids, supplements, and nutraceutical products.

This guide focuses on the potential migration of endocrine-disrupting substances from **plastic containers** into the liquids or capsules they hold, and why the choice of packaging material makes a substantial difference.

## 2. The issue with plastic containers  
Many supplements and liquid products (e.g., aloe vera juice) are packaged in plastic bottles. Under certain conditions—especially exposure to heat and extended storage time—plastic containers can release synthetic substances, including **phthalates**, which are classified as endocrine disruptors.

### 2.1 What are phthalates?  
Phthalates are plasticizers used to increase the flexibility of plastics.  
They can migrate from the container into the product and have been associated with disruptions to the endocrine system (e.g., reproductive hormones).

### 2.2 Experimental evidence  
A comparative test conducted by Salugea examined the migration of phthalates under different packaging conditions:

- An aloe vera juice stored in a **dark glass bottle**:  
  → **No traces of phthalates** were detected.  
  (Source: [salugea.com](https://salugea.com/pages/gli-interferenti-endocrini))

- The same juice stored in a **plastic container**, kept at 25 °C and then for three weeks at 40 °C:  
  → Levels of synthetic substances were **5.5 times higher** than those found in the glass-stored sample, and above regulatory limits.

These findings highlight two key factors:
- the **material** of the container plays a major role in substance migration;  
- **temperature and storage duration** significantly increase migration rates.

## 3. Implications for producers and consumers  

### 3.1 Why dark glass is a safer choice  
- Glass is chemically inert and does not release foreign substances into liquids.  
- Dark glass protects active ingredients from light-induced degradation.  
- In the above test, dark glass showed **zero detectable migration**.

### 3.2 Practical considerations for consumers  
- Prefer products stored in inert and safe materials (glass, stainless steel, certified BPA-free plastics).  
- Avoid leaving plastic-packaged liquids exposed to heat or direct sunlight for prolonged periods.  
- Remember: even natural products can be affected by the **packaging** they are stored in.

## 5. Conclusion  
This document highlights how packaging material is not merely a cost or design decision but a real factor in the **safety**, **purity**, and **preservation** of nutraceutical products.  
Awareness of endocrine disruptors—and how they can migrate from plastics—helps consumers and professionals make safer, more informed choices.
