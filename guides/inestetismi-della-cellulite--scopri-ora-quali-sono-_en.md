## Cellulite: all its imperfections revealed

Let’s start immediately with a necessary clarification. **Cellulite is not just an aesthetic problem**. It is a multifactorial condition that affects about 80% - 90% of women. The incidence of cellulite is higher in women because female hormones, specifically estrogens, play a possible role in its development.

If cellulite is not treated adequately, over time, it can affect a person's general state of well-being, as well as have a negative impact on their mood, especially if particular importance is placed on physical appearance.

At the base of "so-called" cellulite, we find **an alteration of blood circulation, often associated with a change in lymphatic circulation**, which can cause **fluid retention and the accumulation of toxins in tissues**. In many cases, there is also an **increase in the number and size of fat cells**, which are metabolically active and equipped with receptors sensitive to hormones, such as estrogens and insulin, with lipogenic action (fat production and accumulation).

Hence the formation of what **are its imperfections**, which include:

* skin with an orange-peel or mattress appearance
* less compact and toned skin
* skin with an irregular appearance
* localized swelling in the lower limbs, particularly at the ankles
* sensation of heavy legs
* localized fat pads

Now that we have clarified **what the imperfections of cellulite are**, it is time to discover the most suitable natural remedies to combat them effectively and support the functionality of connective tissue.

## Combat cellulite imperfections with plant extracts

Cellulite imperfections can also be treated with a natural approach, combined with a healthy lifestyle and a varied and balanced diet.

For example, it is possible to act effectively on swelling due to fluid accumulation with **Pineapple**, which favors drainage. On the sensation of heaviness in the legs, however, it is possible to intervene profitably with **Centella Asiatica** (Gotu Kola). If the problem is also fat pads, the remedy to evaluate is **Gynostemma**, which intervenes in the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates and liver functions, supporting the body's detoxification processes. **Last but not least**, if you want to act on the primary cause of cellulite, namely the alteration of microcirculation, the remedy for you is **Red Vine**, a precious ally of veins and capillaries.

I know well that, in most cases, these imperfections appear all together. The good news is that to combat them all in a useful and natural way, you don't have to buy a thousand products.

**A single formulation designed to combat cellulite imperfections is that of Biosnel Formula Potenziata!**

Inside you will find all the extracts we told you about earlier.

And the good news doesn't end here. You find these plant extracts in the form of **titrated dry extracts**. Do you already know why this feature is important? If you don't know, don't worry, I'll reveal it to you immediately. Today there are no secrets between you and me.

### The importance of choosing titrated dry extracts

When you choose a supplement, it is important to choose **titrated dry extracts**.

"Dry" because the solvent has been made to evaporate completely; "Titrated" means that the active principle extracted from the plant has been **measured**.

In practice, **titration ensures the certain and constant presence of the active principle extracted from the plant** in every dose of the product, even when it belongs to different batches.

In this way, you are sure to always take the same amount and that the extract is truly active and functional.

In conclusion, a titrated dry extract, compared to a powder, a herbal tea cut, or a simple dry or hydroalcoholic extract, gives you greater precision and control over the presence of plant active ingredients.

For this reason, it is to be preferred.

## Some curiosities about cellulite

Cellulite imperfections have accompanied women for a very long time. Who knows, maybe they have always existed :)

But interest in them began to awaken during the "Roaring Twenties". A very particular historical moment, in which we witness an increase in beauty salons and products and an expansion of the aesthetics and cosmetics sector.

It is precisely in these years that the term "cellulite" begins to be used in the sense in which we are used to using it too.

Think that in the 1930s our dear old friend cellulite conquered the cover of one of the most popular French magazines of the moment: *Votre Beauté*. While in the 40s, it ended up on nothing less than the cover of *Vogue*!

## Simple tips to follow against imperfections

You must know that lifestyle and nutrition also play an important role in the appearance of cellulite imperfections.

A sedentary lifestyle, associated with the consumption of processed foods rich in sugars and industrial fats, opens the door to retention and fat pads.

Here are some useful simple suggestions to follow in everyday life.

First of all, always try to be active. Go to the gym or move regularly at least two or three times a week and try to alternate aerobic activity and toning exercises. If you can't go to the gym, try to walk every day for at least thirty minutes, take the stairs, and do some exercises while you are at home.

If you do a job that forces you to be at a desk for a long time, every thirty minutes, try to get up, take a few steps, and do some exercises.

As for nutrition, however, the best choice is to turn to an expert nutritionist.

In the meantime, you can start paying attention to the foods you choose to bring to the table. For example, try to prefer whole or semi-whole carbohydrates. Regularly consume seasonal vegetables, both cooked and raw, and fresh fruit.

Reduce the consumption of red and fatty meat. Prefer white meat, eggs, and fish and alternate the consumption of proteins of animal origin with those of vegetable origin. For example, foods of vegetable origin that contain all essential amino acids include: tofu, tempeh, buckwheat, and quinoa.

Have you ever tasted scrambled tofu with a side of pan-sautéed asparagus and a salad of fennel, oranges, and Taggiasca olives? If you haven't done it yet, try it now and you'll see how good it is!
