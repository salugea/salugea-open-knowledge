## The signs of a microcirculation in difficulty

As I mentioned a little while ago, the **microcirculation is a system formed by a dense network of capillaries and venules**, which play a fundamental role in the transport of oxygen and nutrients to tissues and in the elimination of metabolic waste.

When this complex system jams, a series of **signals** can occur which include:

* **heaviness and swelling** in the lower limbs;
* appearance of **visible capillaries** on the skin;
* **cold feet**;
* **varicose veins**, in the most serious cases.

It is very important to pay attention to these bells because, **if the microcirculation does not function efficiently, the general well-being of the organism can also suffer** and, as a chain reaction, even the mood.

In some cases, especially when swelling and pain in the legs appear, it may be appropriate to **consult a specialist doctor**, such as an Angiologist for example, who will evaluate the functionality of the venous network with a more in-depth examination.

And now that we have explored the signs of an altered microcirculation, the time has come to discover **how to reactivate it naturally**.

## How to support microcirculation with plant extracts

There are several natural remedies to support the well-being of veins and capillaries. Among these, there are **specific plant extracts to support the functionality of the microcirculation and relieve the annoying sensation of heaviness in the legs**. These extracts include:

* Butcher's Broom (Rusco)
* Horse Chestnut (Ippocastano)
* Sweet Clover (Meliloto)
* Black Currant (Ribes nero)

If you want to make a natural choice, **you find the plant extracts of these plants in the formula of Venasal Salugea.**

It is a supplement formulated according to high quality standards and with **100% natural functional ingredients**, which work synergistically to support circulation and leg well-being. Furthermore, in its formula, you find the plant extracts we mentioned in the form of **titrated dry extracts**.

Among the various forms of processing a plant, **the titrated dry extract is the only one to guarantee the certain and constant presence of the plant active ingredient**. It also ensures that the amount of active ingredient established by the Pharmacopoeia to obtain the desired effect is present in the extract.

A feature that should never be neglected when evaluating a supplement.

And now, what do you think about deepening the knowledge of these wonderful plant extracts?

### Rusco: a plant to (re)discover

Rusco is a small evergreen shrub. Its leaves are small and their shape resembles that of a lance. Another name by which Rusco is known is **Pungitopo** (Butcher's Broom). Does this name ring a bell? Yes, I'm talking about him. The absolute protagonist of Christmas dinners and lunches.

Rusco can prove useful for microcirculation due to its **positive action on vascular tone** and for its **antioxidant properties**. In practice, it supports the venous coat and is a valid ally to counteract the oxidative damage produced by free radicals.

### Horse Chestnut: precious ally of blood vessels

Horse Chestnut is a tree, and quite an imposing one too. Think that it can reach even 40 meters! It has a thick crown and its branches are very dense.

Horse Chestnut is appreciated above all for its positive action on microcirculation. According to what was highlighted in a review of studies, Escin, the active ingredient of Horse Chestnut, **can contribute to effectively reducing edema and the sensation of heaviness in the legs**.

### Meliloto: an ancient remedy to evaluate

Meliloto (Sweet Clover) does not enjoy the fame of other plants, however, its action on microcirculation is truly precious.

It is a herbaceous plant that can reach a meter in height and with characteristic yellow flowers.

Of Meliloto, the positive action on microcirculation and on the drainage of body fluids is appreciated.

It may be interesting to know **that its action involves venous circulation in general** and in particular also **the hemorrhoidal plexus**.

### Ribes nigrum: a plant not just for allergies

Black Currant (Ribes nigrum), among the plants we have explored, is certainly the most famous one. It is, in fact, a remedy often used in case of allergies, because it is able to act on the well-being of the nose and throat, but its action is much broader.

Also in this case, we are faced with a shrub, characterized by small flowers and edible black berries.

Of Black Currant, its action on fluid drainage and its ability to support microcirculation are appreciated above all.

## How to reactivate microcirculation with good habits

Lifestyle plays a leading role in supporting the well-being of microcirculation 360 degrees. Here are some useful and simple suggestions to follow in everyday life:

* **maintain an active lifestyle**: sedentary lifestyle and alterations of the microcirculation, alas, go hand in hand. To keep legs light it is important to practice physical activity regularly. Even a simple walk can contribute to keeping the microcirculation active. The movement of the foot while walking, in fact, helps the pumping of blood and its return to the heart;
* **maintain body balance**: being overweight can put a strain on microcirculation. This is why it is important to promote body balance. A balanced diet, associated with an active lifestyle, can help you maintain a healthy weight and, consequently, the well-being of your legs;
* **elevate your legs**: if you spend a lot of time sitting, or standing, remember to lift your legs from time to time, or to move them a little. This will allow you to reactivate circulation. For example, you can lie on your back on the bed and keep your legs up by resting them against the wall. This will help you reduce the sensation of heaviness. While taking a few steps, every thirty minutes you are sitting or standing, will help you reactivate circulation;
* **avoid smoking**: this is a factor that can alter the well-being of the microcirculation and that of the organism in general. You must know, in fact, that smoking has a negative impact on blood vessels and circulation;
* **give importance to hydration**: drinking water is a gesture as simple as it is precious to support the well-being of the organism. In fact, among many things, it promotes diuresis and the elimination of fluids.

Following these habits every day will help you actively and naturally promote the well-being of your microcirculation and you will see that, with time, your legs will thank you!
