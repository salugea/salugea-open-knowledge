## Purify the skin with natural remedies: here is which ones to choose

Nature offers many allies to **purify the skin**, keep it luminous, and counteract impurities. Among the most suitable natural remedies we find:

### Fumaria (Fumitory), with purifying properties

Fumaria is a plant known for its purifying properties, ideal for eliminating toxins that accumulate and can cause impurities. Furthermore, it exercises a positive action also on the well-being and functionality of the skin. It can be taken in the form of herbal tea or as a supplement.

We advise you to choose it in the form of **titrated dry extract** because it guarantees the highest concentration of natural active ingredient. You find it in this form in the food supplement **Epasal**, formulated for liver depuration.


### Aloe Vera juice: choose it pure and organic

Aloe Vera is a true elixir for the skin. Thanks to its content of antioxidants and vitamins and its purifying action, Aloe can contribute to eliminating toxins, with a possible positive effect also on the skin. Choose **pure Aloe vera from organic farming, rigorously preserved in dark glass** of pharmaceutical grade (**not in plastic**).

### Probiotics and skin

Often **skin well-being starts from the intestine**. **Probiotics favor the balance of intestinal bacterial flora**, supporting not only digestion and nutrient absorption but also the body's ability to eliminate toxins **with a positive fallout on the skin**. Not everyone knows, in fact, that the intestine is part of the emunctory organs and one of its tasks is to eliminate waste and toxins.

Choosing these natural remedies and integrating them into your daily routine can make a big difference. Combine them with a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle for even more visible and long-lasting results.

## Foods to purify the skin: what to bring to the table

**Luminous skin starts from the table!**

There are foods that, thanks to their nutrients, can contribute to purifying the skin from the inside and keeping it free from impurities.

Here is what should never be missing from your diet:

* **Whole grains**: rich in fiber, they favor – together with probiotics – intestinal well-being;
* **Legumes**: excellent source of vegetable proteins and minerals, such as Iron, Magnesium, and Zinc, fundamental for skin well-being;
* **Fruit and vegetables**: thanks to their high content of **antioxidants**, they fight free radicals that can cause oxidative stress and accelerate skin aging. Among the most important antioxidants we find **Glutathione**, a molecule that supports the body's detoxification processes;
* **Fish rich in Omega-3**: salmon, mackerel, sardines, and other fatty fish are precious allies for the skin because they are sources of Omega 3. These essential fatty acids can contribute to maintaining skin hydration and the skin barrier function.

Integrating these foods into your daily diet can act positively on the appearance of the skin, keeping it luminous, toned, and hydrated.

## Treatments to clean the skin deeply

To have clean skin free from imperfections it is important to also evaluate targeted external treatments that act optimally. Among the most used we find:

* **chemical peels**: treatments that use specific active ingredients to exfoliate the skin and remove dead cells. **Glycolic acid** can contribute to illuminating the complexion and stimulating cell turnover, while **salicylic acid** can contribute to counteracting impurities;
* **mechanical peels**: involve the use of scrubs containing natural micro-granules, such as pulverized **apricot kernel**, for delicate but effective exfoliation. This type of peeling contributes to eliminating dead cells and leaves the skin smooth and soft;
* **clay masks**: perfect for purifying the skin and counteracting excess sebum.

It is fundamental to avoid **DIY** and rely on qualified professionals and products formulated specifically for your skin type.

An unsuitable treatment could irritate the skin or worsen imperfections. For optimal results, combine these treatments with a daily skincare routine studied for your needs.

## Herbal teas to purify the skin: dandelion and burdock

**Herbal teas can be a simple and natural way to favor skin depuration**, thanks to their ability to support toxin elimination processes.

Here are two perfect allies for the well-being of your skin:

* **Dandelion herbal tea**: Dandelion (Tarassaco), also known as lion's tooth, is a natural purifier worthy of respect. It supports liver function, digestive function, and intestinal transit, favoring the elimination of toxins that often can be reflected on the skin in the form of impurities and imperfections;
* **Burdock herbal tea**: Burdock (Bardana) is a plant with purifying and draining properties, ideal for those who want a detox break;
* **Nettle herbal tea**: Nettle (Ortica) is known for its purifying and draining properties. It supports the elimination of toxins and excess fluids. Furthermore, the root has a positive action on the well-being of nails and hair.

It should be remembered that herbal teas, while beneficial, have a milder effect compared to **titrated dry extracts**, which are concentrated and provide greater quantities of active ingredients. For a more marked effect, it is also advisable to integrate dry extracts with a balanced diet and targeted skincare.

## How much water to drink to purify the skin

Water also plays a fundamental role for the general well-being of the organism and, in particular, for that of the skin.

Drinking a sufficient amount of water every day can contribute to maintaining an adequate level of hydration and favoring the elimination of toxins and waste through diuresis. And if there are fewer toxins around, the appearance of the skin also benefits.

We advise you to choose natural **oligomineral water**.

The ideal amount to drink depends on various factors, such as age, body weight, and level of physical activity, but generally, it is recommended to take **1.5-2 liters of water per day** or better, **30 ml per kilo of body weight**. You can increase intake during hot periods or if you practice intense physical activity.

Remember that correct hydration, combined with a balanced diet and specific treatments, is one of the pillars for luminous skin free from imperfections.

## Cleopatra's secret for beautiful skin: the milk bath

Cleopatra, the legendary Queen of Egypt, is famous not only for her charm but also for her beauty rituals, including the famous **bath in donkey milk**, rich in vitamins and nutrients. This ancient treatment was her secret for soft, luminous, and young skin.

If you want to experiment with the "Cleopatra method" at home, you can add a glass of whole milk or a little powdered milk to your bathtub water, but we don't guarantee the result! ?
